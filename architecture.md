DATA FLOWS:
User → [UI] → [API] → [UI] → [DB]

MEREOLOGICAL MAP:
Component ∈ Service ∈ Module ∈ Root

UPCOMING STRATEGIC SHIFTS:
- UI: Transitioning to Graph/Node-based canvas (e.g., React Flow).
- Data: Expanding types to support Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) for prompt lineage and evolutionary tracking.
- Sharing: Introducing import/export mechanisms for Collaborative Blueprints.
